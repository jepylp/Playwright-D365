# Playwright-D365
Starting Position Playwright tests for D365

Tests for 010, 012, and 014 are similar and are used a launch point for customization
These also include auto incrementing the vendor name so a duplicate is not generated

Test-multi demostrates how to import a CSV file to use for testing

We have a Auth setup file that handles connecting to D365 for the tests
